Output this reasoning as a short bulleted plan. Every line of the script you write in Phase 2 must map back to something in this plan -- don't write freeform and retrofit a plan afterward.

PHASE 2 -- <draft_v1>: Write a complete first draft following the retention plan and the output format spec below.

PHASE 3 -- <self_critique>: Switch roles. You are now a ruthless short-form video editor reviewing a stranger's draft, not the person who wrote it. Find at least 3 concrete, specific flaws -- quote the exact line and name the failure (weak/slow hook, a hard constraint violated, a dead pacing stretch, a mismatched CTA, generic language that could apply to any creator). Do not praise anything here; this phase only exists to find what's wrong.

PHASE 4 -- <final_script>: Revise draft_v1 to fix every flaw found in Phase 3. Before outputting, re-read the result against every item in hard_constraints above, one by one, and confirm each is satisfied -- fix anything that isn't. Then output ONLY the final script, in this exact format:

Respect this concept split: ${opts.conceptRatio.proven}% Proven Concepts (topics/hooks modeled on outlier research), ${opts.conceptRatio.doubleDown}% Doubling Down (variants of my own past outliers), ${opts.conceptRatio.experimental}% Original Experiments.

A) Keep most elements identical, tweak only the value/details.
B) Keep the structure/format identical, change the topic entirely.
C) Keep the core topic identical, present it in a completely new filming format.

For each variant give: new topic/angle, hook idea, and format to use.

GOOD variant (method B example): original was "3 pricing mistakes I made" (list format) → new: "3 pricing mistakes founders make when entering the US market" (same list format, new topic sliced narrower).
BAD variant (avoid): a "double down" that changes everything at once (new topic, new format, new angle) -- that's not doubling down on what worked, it's a new experiment wearing a disguise.`;

BAD keyword: "#consultinglife" (a hashtag, not a search phrase -- won't surface outlier research the same way).`;

Prioritize measurable, specific value over generic advice. Cite the type of source (study/book/framework name) where relevant.

GOOD idea: "The 'beachhead market' concept from Geoffrey Moore's Crossing the Chasm -- why founders should pick ONE narrow segment to dominate before expanding, with a real cost-of-spreading-too-thin example."
BAD idea (too vague to script, avoid): "Talk about the importance of market research."`;

For each episode give: Episode title | Hook (written + verbal) | Core value point (hyper-specific, not generic) | Script angle to use | Suggested filming format.
Return as a numbered list, one episode per number. Keep total series watchable as a binge -- each episode must stand alone but reward watching the series in order.

${craftRulesBlock()}

GOOD episode value point: "In [industry], the #1 killer isn't competition -- it's a 6-9 month regulatory approval window most founders don't budget for."
BAD episode value point (avoid): "This industry has a lot of opportunity but also some challenges to consider."`;

For each problem: name it in one line, explain why it's painful/costly, and suggest which script angle (framework, myth bust, comparison, transformation, etc.) would best address it as a short-form video.

GOOD problem: "Founders quote a flat consulting fee without scoping regulatory complexity first, then eat the cost overrun themselves." (specific, costly, scriptable as a myth-bust or transformation video)
BAD problem (avoid): "Business can be hard to figure out sometimes."`;

2. Hooks -- a full hook stack (written, verbal, visual), hyper-specific.
3. Value -- the actual "meat": what specific, measurable knowledge/story does this deliver (not fluffy/vague)?
4. Script angle -- which of the 7 angles fits best (framework, comparison, myth bust, do/don't, tip/hack, transformation, challenge) and why.
5. CTA -- follow, engagement, ManyChat, or none, matched to a funnel stage (TOFU/MOFU/BOFU). Reference: ${Object.values(CTA_GUIDANCE).join(" ")}
6. Video format -- which of the 12 filming formats suits this idea, prioritizing my preferred formats: ${brand.formatPrefs.join(", ")}.
7. Editing notes -- 2-3 concrete on-screen text/graphic ideas using my visual assets: ${brand.assetTypes.join(", ")}.

TASK: Write my Instagram profile using the 4-line bio framework (so a viewer understands who I am and what I offer within 5 seconds):
Line 1: Who I am / role (hook-y, not just a title)
Line 2: Who I help + how (specific outcome, not vague)
Line 3: Proof/credibility (a specific number from my track record: ${brand.proprietaryValue})
Line 4: A single clear next step pointing to my one bio link (${brand.bioLink})

Also give me:
- 3 options for the searchable name field, in the format "[Name] | [Keyword/Niche/Occupation]" using my niche (${brand.niche}) and sub-niches (${brand.subniches.join(", ")}).
- A one-line check on my current handle/name field choice: "${brand.nameField}" -- does it read as spammy, confusing, or unclear? If so, fix it.

GOOD bio line 2 (specific outcome): "I help founders enter new markets without the $40K pricing mistakes."
BAD bio line 2 (avoid -- generic, could describe anyone): "Helping people achieve their business dreams ✨"

Keep every line specific and outcome-focused, no generic "helping people achieve their goals" language, no emojis unless they carry real meaning.`;

TASK: Write the ManyChat automated DM sequence for this comment-trigger automation:
Trigger word (what viewers comment): "${opts.triggerWord}"
Offer being delivered: "${opts.offer}"

Give me:
1. The public comment-reply ManyChat sends before DMing (short, confirms it's coming).
2. The DM opening message (warm, on-brand, references the video they commented on).
3. The DM's actual delivery message with a single clear link to ${brand.bioLink}.
4. One optional follow-up message to send 24 hours later if they haven't clicked the link.

GOOD DM opener: "Hey! Saw you commented ${opts.triggerWord} on the pricing video -- here's the framework I promised, no fluff."
BAD DM opener (avoid -- reads like a bot, no reference to why they're getting this): "Hello! Thank you for your interest. Please find the link below."

Keep it conversational, first-person, zero corporate tone -- this is a DM from ${brand.nameField.split("|")[0].trim()}, not a bot.`;

1. Hook type used (written/verbal/visual) and the specific hook text -- why does it stop the scroll?
2. Script angle (framework, comparison, myth bust, do/don't, tip/hack, transformation, or challenge).
3. Value type -- personal experience/knowledge, or a credible external source?
4. Structure -- map the video beat-by-beat (opening, build, payoff, CTA).
5. What's replicable vs. what's specific to that creator/niche (so I know what to actually copy vs. leave behind).

Be blunt about what's actually doing the work vs. what's incidental -- a good deconstruction says "the hook works because it names a specific dollar amount," not "the hook is engaging."`;

Funnel stages:
${allFunnelGuide()}

CTA types:
${allCtaGuide()}

${craftRulesBlock()}

Work through this in 3 explicit phases, in order. Do not skip ahead.

PHASE 1 -- <diagnosis>: List every weakness in the existing script. For each one, cite the exact line or beat, name the failure category (hook / pacing / specificity / craft-rule violation / CTA-funnel mismatch / format mismatch / persuasion structure), and tag its severity as HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW. Be adversarial -- you are a ruthless editor reviewing a stranger's draft, not the person who wrote it. Also explicitly note anything that's already strong and should NOT be touched (a real hook, a specific number, a line with real proof) -- name it so it survives the rewrite.

PHASE 2 -- <fix_plan>: Order the HIGH severity issues first, then MEDIUM, then LOW. For each, state the specific fix (not "make it better" -- the actual replacement line, structural change, or format/angle/funnel/CTA swap, citing the reference guide above if a swap is recommended). If everything is already strong, say so explicitly instead of inventing fixes to seem thorough.

PHASE 3 -- <revised_script>: Rewrite the script implementing every fix from the plan, in priority order, while explicitly preserving every line flagged as already-strong in Phase 1 -- don't regenerate what wasn't broken. Before finalizing, re-check the result against the crisp-script rules above, one by one. Then output ONLY the final result in this exact format, nothing before or after:
BLACK (spoken dialogue, line by line):
- ...
RED (physical actions / camera movement instructions):
- ...
GREEN (editing / graphic instructions for the editor):
- ...
(If you recommended a format, angle, funnel stage, or CTA change in Phase 2, state it in one line above the BLACK section, then write the script for the NEW recommendation, not the old one.)`;
